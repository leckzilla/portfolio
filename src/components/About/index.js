      <p>

I’m a customer experience type turned junior developer with a strong interest in UX/UI design and a general fascination with human behaviour.
Despite having probably the most unfortunate name in tech these days I decided at the end of 2019 I was going to take a massive leap of
faith and change my career. By January 2020 I was one of 24 extremely lucky people to earn a place on School of Code’s 3rd bootcamp,
so with career break notice handed in to HR off I went!<br/>
<br/>
During the bootcamp I found a real interest in user experience and I found a lot of what I’d learned in 10 years of customer service
(read: getting shouted at for a living) was totally transferable and so after the bootcamp I threw myself into the world of UX/UI.
Now I’m seeking my first tech role and am raring to expand on what I’ve started to learn.<br/>
<br/>
When I’m not drinking tea at my laptop I can be found drinking tea at my local Women’s Institute group, shimmying as part of a belly
dance troupe, sewing my own clothes one disaster at a time or donning a hi-vis jacket and radio and stewarding for Oxfam at the UK’s
biggest festivals.<br/>
<br/>
I love a natter so do get in touch via the contact link above!
